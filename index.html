        <div id="about">
            <h1>Who I Am</h1>
            <h2>My Work Style</h2>
            <p>I am a very quick learner. You may notice there are some skills or concepts within web development that I have not yet acquired. Although this may be true, I am able to pick up on things very easily compared to others and I am very determined to learn new things. I am a perfectionist. Whatever project I am working on, it has to be exactly how I pictured it to look. I am the type of person who will not stop working until I am satisfied. I am a compassionate team player, always thinking of others before myself.</p>
            <h2>What Motivates Me</h2>
            <p>The main thing that motivates me is my loved ones. My family and significant other are the ones who push me to be the best version of myself and are my biggest supporters. Aside from this, I am motivated by opportunities to grow within the web development field. There are so many things you can do with web development and design. Speaking of, my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer. I would like to start small and begin a career within front-end development, while further educating myself with programming languages that I would utilize inside back-end development. I wish to bring the entrepreneurial spirit and drive that I have to the next position I acquire, and leave a digital footprint with my designs and interactivity.</p>

                            <p>I am teaching myself JavaScript via Netacad, and will be recieving a certification after I complete the course exam.</p>

                            <p>I am teaching myself Python via Netacad, and will be recieving a certification after I complete the course exam. I am also utilizing YouTube for game tutorials.</p>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                            <p>Currently, I have a familiarity as to what PHP syntax looks like. My goal is to expand that familiarity into a base knowledge of the language itself, and begin programming simple projects.</p>
                        <li>C++</li>
                            <p>My knowledge of C++ is the same as listed for PHP. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                            <p>I have been writing fluent HTML since February of 2022. Although I am still studying the markup language in school and at home, I would say I am very close to knowing the "in's and out's" of HTML5.</p>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                            <p>My experience with CSS is the same for HTML. I have recently begun configuring CSS bootstraps to some of my code, and I am currently learning how to manipulate it.</p>
                        <li>GitHub</li>
                            <p>As of recently, I have my most current projects uploaded to GitHub. In fact, this is how I was able to post this site via GitHub pages! I am super excited to get my code out for others to visualize. I am very active on GitHub, considering I update my code at least 3-4 times a week. Although I have almost all of my projects privately posted, I am willing to provide the source code to any employers who are willing to reach out.</p>
                        <li>Terminal</li>
                            <p>I have recently been educating myself on how to manipulate, download and install items through terminal commands via MacOS.</p>
                        <li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
                            <p>Last spring of 2022, I was taught how to navigate Adobe Creative Cloud which included creating projects via Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
                        <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                        <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                        <li>Adobe InDesign</li>
                            <p>This past spring I was educated on the navigation of InDesign and it's typographical efforts.</p>
                        <li>Microsoft Office</li>
                        <p>Since middle school, I have been utilizing Micorsoft Office, which included a skillset of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and most recently, Outlook and Teams.</p>
                        <li>Microsoft Word</li>

                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I created a logo for myself that represents my name as well as my purpose. My purpose is to, "Create", while the connection of the first two letters create my first and last initials. You may also notice that these two letters create an, "a" in the center using its negative space, representing my middle inital.</p>
